# Asking for feedback
There are a number of places you can ask for feedback, however you're likely to get different levels of response dependent upon the chosen platform. 
- **Reddit:** Able to gain attention, however due to the upvote/downvote system you arenâ€™t likely to get many in depth responses. ([/r/KeycapDesigners](https://www.reddit.com/r/keycapdesigners/), [/r/MechanicalKeyboards](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/))
- **Discord:** Structured responses, will likely point out issues that could hinder you later if not resolved.
- **Geekhack:** ONLY post on the Interest Check forum if you have a completed draft, otherwise you will be subject to harsh criticisms. For feedback you are better posting in [Keyboard Keycaps](https://geekhack.org/index.php?board=80.0).

**There are other communities such as Facebook groups, Keebtalk, ZFrontier and so on that are also worth exploring or making use of.**

At this point in time, what you want is a good solid foundation. Be it a set of colors, or simply an inspiration, you can receive inspiration from others and shape your set to be the best it can be.
This is also a good place to get a name/settle on a name for your set. The name is one of the few things I would not recommend changing after starting an IC. This just helps people keep track of your set easily and gives some sense of identity.
