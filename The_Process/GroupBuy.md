# Group Buy (AKA, The GB)

So weâ€™re finally at the stage of the group buy. You should ensure to post your GB page at minimum a day before it goes live so that geekhack moderators have an adequate amount of time to verify it - You may need to PM them to remind them. You should also make sure your vendor store links and MOQs are clearly shown in your post. On the day of the GB, make sure all your vendors are ready to have their page go live and make sure to update your IC to link to the group buy post.

Whilst your GB is live your job is to create hype around your set. Post on Reddit, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and even change your discord status to make as much awareness for your set as possible.
