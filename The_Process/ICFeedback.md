# IC Feedback & Finalizing

This may seem self-explanatory however it's now time to go through the feedback you received from your IC and identify what you should and shouldn’t be working on and making revisions accordingly. 

Before we move on there are some things we need to do. So what else do you need to consider? Well, you should have an idea of when you want to run your set either by month or financial quarter, what regions you want to cover, and a final decision on your chosen colours. Once you have finalized your kitting this would be a good time to start asking for quotes from manufacturers either through vendors or directly (See: Manufacturers shopping list for further details). 

The below is a list of Vendors region that have ran group buys:

    - AlphaKeys, ApexKeyboards, Ashkeebs, Deskhero, Keyspresso, KumaMech

**PLEASE NOTE:** This list is not exhaustive and you should do your own research when trying to find a vendor. Most people tend to pick this based on the region they currently live or operate within.

Please also remember that you will be required to sign a contract with your main chosen vendor. AS I’m sure you are aware, contracts are very important to any business as the set out specific terms and condition between two separate parties. It is your responsibility to check over your contract so that you know what you are agreeing to. If you run in and sign a contract without first reading you may be agreeing to terms or conditions that unknowingly favour one party heavily, leading to unfavorable scenarios one might not have considered.  Where you are unsure about any aspect of your contract ASk questions to seek clarification **in writing**. If you don't like something, negotiate for better terms before you sign it.

As an example, you should be wary of any additional fees that other parties impose upon you, and if the contract specifies you handing over the rights of the design to the vendor, then do consider if that is something you are willing to accept when it comes to the possibility of future re-runs of your design. 

**If you are a minor, please take the steps to protect yourself by being open about your age with whomever you are signing the contract for, so they can change the contract accordingly. This protects both yourself and the vendor.**
