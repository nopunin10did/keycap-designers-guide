Well done. Youâ€™ve run your race and now we tally the results. Whether you reached your MOQ or not take note of the lessons you have learnt so that you can do a better job next time. At this point you can choose to release your final sales numbers or not but you have nothing to lose by doing so. Finally make sure to communicate with your vendor/s about payment.
