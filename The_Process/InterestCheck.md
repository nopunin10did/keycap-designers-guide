# Interest Check (AKA, The IC)

At this stage you should be nearing a “final draft” in terms of your design. If you haven't done so already, now is the time to look into having someone do a render of your set (or creating a render yourself) to showcase it. Likewise, if you haven’t considered or undertaken, now is the time to start considering some accompanying items such as novelties and deskmats.

An IC is, essentially, your market research. It will give you tangible numbers of interest for your set as well as what people want to see added into it. Likewise, you may find that there is a lack of interest for one aspect of your set and is not worth running.

You can run your interest check form however you like (Recommend: Google Forms) but it is recommended you ask, at the very least:
- Are you interested in buying this set?
- Which kit(s) would you purchase during group buy?
- Any changes (Additions/Removals) you would like to see?
- Additional Comments

You should monitor and make sure you are flexible to change things based on community input. **However, know what you won’t compromise on because people will try to make your set their set.**

You should make time to go through the interest check forum of Geekhack and note what other successful IC’s have done. Your IC shouldn’t just encompass the gathering of interest, it should also be a project log of changes. Have a running work log with what you are currently or planning to work on, and ~~strike through~~ them after you are done instead of deleting them. This is to show so what has been done. A rushed IC will only hold you back and the community will be more than happy to point out a rushed job. Please take your time and try to get everything as close to perfect as you can.

You can post your Interest check to other sites but many people use Geekhack as their central location for updates and/our progress reports.
